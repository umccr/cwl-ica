      A tab separated file listing gene pairs that have a high level of similarity.
      The first and second column are the gene names, and the third column is the e-score.
      This list of gene pairs is used as a homology filter to reduce false positives.
      For runs on human genome assemblies GRCH38 and hg19, DRAGEN automatically
      applies a default file generated using Gencode Human Release 32 annotations for primary chromosomes
      if no other file is specified using the command-line.
