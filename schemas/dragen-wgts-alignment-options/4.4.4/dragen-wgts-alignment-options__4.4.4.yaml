  # RRNA Filtering options
  rrna_filter_enable:
    label: rrna filter enable
    doc: |
      Enables the removal of rRNA reads from the output alignment records.
    type: boolean?
  rrna_filter_contig:
    label: rrna filter contigs
    doc: |
      Sets the name of the rRNA sequences to use for filtering.
      If you do not specify a value, the default gl000220 is used for human genome alignments
      with the reference autodetect feature.
      gl000220 is an unplaced contig included in hg19 and hg38 genomes,
      which include a full copy of the rRNA repeat.
      For other genomes, you must include a rRNA decoy contig when creating a hash table.
    type: string?
  # RNA - PolyA trimming by read orientation
  rna_library_type:
    label: rna library type
    doc: |
      Specifies the type of RNA-seq library. The following are the available values:
      IU - Paired-end unstranded library.
      ISR - Paired-end stranded library in which read2 matches the transcript strand (eg, Illumina Stranded Total RNA Prep).
      ISF - Paired-end stranded library in which read1 matches the transcript strand.
      U - Single-end unstranded library.
      SR - Single-end stranded library in which reads are in reverse orientation to the transcript strand (eg, Illumina Stranded Total RNA Prep).
      SF - Single-end stranded library in which reads match the transcript strand.
      A -  DRAGEN examines the first reads pairs in the data set to automatically detect the correct library type. For polya tail trimming, the library type is assumed to be unstranded. Autodetect is the default value.
    type: string?
  # Cufflinks compatibility
  rna_mapq_unique:
    label: rna mapq unique
    doc: |
