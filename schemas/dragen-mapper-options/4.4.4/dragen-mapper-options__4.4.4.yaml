name: dragen-mapper-options
fields:
  ann_sj_max_indel:
    label: ann_sj_max_indel
    doc: |
      Specifies maximum indel length to expect near an annotated splice junction.
    type: int?
  edit_chain_limit:
    label: edit chain limit
    doc: |
      For edit-mode 1 or 2, the option sets maximum seed chain length in a read to qualify for seed editing.
    type: int?
  edit_mode:
    label: edit_mode
    doc: |
      Controls when seed editing is used. The following values represent the different edit modes: 0 is no edits, 1 is chain length test, 2 is paired chain length test, 3 is full seed edits
    type: int?
  edit_read_len:
    label: edit_read_len
    doc: |
      For edit-mode 1 or 2, controls the read length for edit-seed-num seed editing positions.
    type: int?
  edit_seed_num:
    label: edit-seed-num
    doc: |
      For edit-mode 1 or 2, controls the requested number of seeds per read to allow editing on.
    type: int?
  map_orientations:
    label: map_orientations
    doc: |
      Restricts the orientation of read mapping to only forward in the reference genome or only reverse-complemented. The following values represent the different orientations (paired end requires normal):0 is normal (paired-end inputs must use normal), 1 is reverse-complemented, 2 is no forward
    type: int?
  max_intron_bases:
    label: max_intron_bases
    doc: |
      Specifies maximum intron length reported.
    type: int?
  min_intron_bases:
    label: min_intron_bases
    doc: |
      Specifies minimum reference deletion length reported as an intron.
    type: int?
  seed_density:
    label: seed_density
    doc: |
      Controls requested density of seeds from reads queried in the hash table
    type: int?
